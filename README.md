Unbounded-Obstruction-Free-Deque

This directory contains code for

(1) a generic test harness (cpp_harness) for concurrent data structures
    written in C++.  This is primarily the work of Joseph Izraelevitz
    (Joseph.Izraelevitz@colorado.edu).

(2) an unbounded extension of the obstruction-free double-ended queue of 
    Herlihy, Luchangco, and Moir [IDCDS 2003].  This is joint work of
    Matthew Graichen (matt.graichen@gmail.com), Joseph Izraelevitz, and
    Michael L. Scott (scott@cs.rochester.edu).  It was published at ICPP
    2016.
